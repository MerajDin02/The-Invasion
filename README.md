# The-Invasion
This game we made called "The Invasion" is inspired by the arcade game "Space Invaders"
It is a game where you have to shoot down alien ships while they move and shoot back at you.
Just use the left and right arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot. 
And if you get hit, your health bar decreases.
You can only take 3 hits until your health bar is fully depleted and the game is over.
Or take down all the alien ships to beat the game.

Our original plan was to make the game keep track of your score and allow you to keep going when all the alien ships
were taken down. We also wanted to make a play again buttton if the game was ended because you had no more lives.
But under the circumstances and the time we had, we just made the game end once you've taken down all the alien ships.
